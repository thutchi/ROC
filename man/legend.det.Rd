\title{ Add a legnd to a DET plot }
\description{
  This function puts a legend in a DET plot.  According to what your
  typical performance is, you can place the legen either in the upper
  right corner or lower left corner. 
}
\usage{
legend.det(legend, where = "ur", order = 1:length(legend), col, lty)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{legend}{ An array of legend texts}
  \item{where}{ Position to place legend in plot, "ur" or "ll" }
  \item{order}{ Order in which the legend text and lines are to be
    plotted, so allow legend order to match lines in the DET plot }
  \item{col}{ The colors of the lines, as reference to the palette}
  \item{lty}{ The line types of the lines }
}
\details{
  The main task of this function is to place the box in an easy way.
