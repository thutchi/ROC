\title{ Compute a contingency table from an sre object }
\description{
  For averaging detection trial lists that were obtained from different
  experimental conditions, the amounts of trials in these conditions
  should be weighted.  This function computes a contingency table from
  an \code{cst} object.
}
\usage{
cond.table(x, cond, target = F)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{ An object of class \code{cst}, or compatible data frame or \code{roc} object}
  \item{cond}{ A list of factors making up the various conditions }
  \item{target}{ Is column \code{target} to be interpreted as a factor? }
}
\details{
  This function produces a table of the number of trials for each
  condition in a trial list.  Conditions are specified by all
  combinations of all levels of the factors specified in \code{cond}.
  Conditions with no trials are left out of the table.

  This table can be used in equalizing the influence of different
  implicit conditions in a larger set of trials, such as NIST SRE-2008.
  In order to do this properly, the analysis needs to be carried out
  separately for target and non-target trials, this can be specified by
  \code{target=TRUE}.

  This function is used by the functions \code{det.sre()}  and
  \code{plot.cond(), but can be used separately as well.}
}
\value{
  A data.frame with a columns for each factor, specifying the condition,
  and the column \code{Freq} that indicated the trial count.
